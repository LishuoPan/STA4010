#### Preprocess analysis:



##### data completion:

- the oral data is provided in .csv file.

- the data contain 5 features: time, Bid price, Bid size, Ask price, Ask size as described in the project description. 

- the table looks like this:

![Oral data](/Users/panlishuo/GoogleDrive/CUHK,sz/STA 4010/project/Final Project_Tsang/Document/images/Oral data.png)



- Strategy: The first row is completed as the market is open. We run through each row of the data: if the value is "NA" then assign it as the same value as the value in the same column last row:

  $P_{i,j} = P_{i-1,j}$



- structure data: here we add time slot as integer to replace the first column of the data frame. the feature matrix is: $\boldsymbol{X}_{i} = [t_{i}, Bidsize, Asksize;$ the response is $\boldsymbol{y}_{bid} = Bidprice$ and $\boldsymbol{y}_{ask} = Askprice$ 



##### Sample the data into minute unit (option).

according to the first column of the data frame, sample the original data into minute unit.

This can largely cut the computation time.

##### Profit Strategy Analysis:



- `Strategy i: Hold the Stock:`

   - $Bid_{j} > Ask_{i}$,   $for\ j > i$ $.  ~$i.e. $Bid_{i+k} - Ask_{i}> 0, given\  k > 0$

- `Strategy ii: Short Selling: `

   - $Ask_{j}\le Bid_{i}$,   $for\ j\ge i$ $~$e.g. $Ask_{i+k} - Bid_{i}\le 0, given\ k >0$


##### Whole Trend (with conclusion):

- Analysis the overall trend:
- 4 days data plot:

- Simple linear regression on 2 part(divided by the big drap):
- $\boldsymbol{y}_{bid} = \boldsymbol{X} \cdot \beta + \epsilon$
- $\boldsymbol{y}_{ask} = \boldsymbol{X} \cdot \beta + \epsilon$

- Conclusion: This overall pridiction suggest that we should use `strategy ii` more often, or we should say use `statrgy i` more cautious.



##### Simple Trade Simulation:

- Definition: buy in one share with `strategy i` or `strategy ii` at time $t_i$ exercise the share at $t_{i+k}$. 
- Grid search to find the optimal $k$. For this kind of simulation. 
- $arg \max_\limits{k}\ (profit\ times)$
- perform the simulation on training data set(divided by big drop):

![Hyper_search i](/Users/panlishuo/GoogleDrive/CUHK,sz/STA 4010/project/Final Project_Tsang/Document/images/Hyper_search i.png)

![Hyper_search ii](/Users/panlishuo/GoogleDrive/CUHK,sz/STA 4010/project/Final Project_Tsang/Document/images/Hyper_search ii.png)

Conclusion: 

```
The optimal k is: 70.0
the weight for the first strategy(hold the stock) is: 0.346690457155121 
the weight for the Second strategy(short selling) is: 0.653309542844879
```

This conclusion can be as a verification of previous section.



#### System Construction:

##### Machanism: 

- process though the incoming time slot: For each incoming time point $t$ we do regression once. Updating the regression model for each time point. $Model_{t}$ for each time $t$.

##### Definitions:

- Cut: 0 means keep the original data size, 1 means sample in minute unit.

- prediction window $p$: at $t$ predict $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{bid}(t) \cdots\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{bid}(t+p)$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{ask}(t) \cdots\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{ask}(t+p)$ 
- training window $s$: each $Model_{t}$ train on the data points $\boldsymbol{x}_{t-s}\cdots \boldsymbol{x}_{t}$ 
- Random seed rng: seed.
- split $d$ : how many grid we investigate. Spread money over time, not buy in at once. Following picture, we can see buy in stock at $t_2$is better than buy in at $t_1$. for each $t$ we most buy 1 time stock and 1 time short sell. The money total money investigated in the $\frac{Money_{current}}{d}$. As the analysis previously, 30% money goes to `strategy i` 70% money goes to `strategy ii`. Difine each time of exercise as one piece of stock or short selling.

- Resampling times B: resampling time to the training data for each regression model
- Max inventory level L: how many piece of stock or short selling we could hold.
- Max hold time H: how long we can hold each piece of stock or short selling
- Initial money M: 100
- Cautious coeffience $\rho$: How much cautious we want when buy in stock.



##### When to buy in the stock or process short selling:

- use training data fit the regression model.

- At $t$, make a prediction ahead of size $p$. We get $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{bid}(t) \cdots\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{bid}(t+p)$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{ask}(t) \cdots\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{ask}(t+p)$ 
- Find $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{bid\ max}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{ask\ min}$
- if $\rho\cdot\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{bid\ max} >\boldsymbol{y}_{ask}(t)$: then buy in one piece of stock. In this case, we expect the `strategy i` could make profit
- if $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{ask\ min}< \boldsymbol{y}_{bid}(t)$: then exercise one piece of short selling. we expect the `strategy ii` could make profit

##### When to exercise the hold:

Review:

- Profit Condition: `strategy i` or `strategy ii` 

- `Strategy i: Hold the Stock:`

  - $Bid_{j} > Ask_{i}$,   $for\ j > i$ $.  ~$i.e. $Bid_{i+k} - Ask_{i}> 0, given\  k > 0$

- `Strategy ii: Short Selling: `

  - $Ask_{j}\le Bid_{i}$,   $for\ j\ge i$ $~$e.g. $Ask_{i+k} - Bid_{i}\le 0, given\ k >0$


- `Plan i`: At each time $t$, go though all the holden stocks and short selling. Once the profit condition meet exercise the holden piece.

- `Plan ii`: 

  If $[\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{bid}, y_{bid}(t)]_{max} = y_{bid}(t)$ : that means  $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{bid}$ will not go up an more, we get the highest  $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{bid}$, go through the stock and exercise ones meets the profit condition.  

  If $[\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{ask}, y_{ask}(t)]_{min} = y_{ask}(t)$: that means $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{ask}$ will not go down anymore, we get the lowest $\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_{ask}$ we can get, go through the short selling and exercise ones meets the profit condition. 

- In practice `Plan i` and `Plan ii` no big difference.



##### Safe Gaurd:

- since we will use short selling, in the process we may have lots of money in the packet. To prevent invest too much into the market. We use a saft gaurd switch. Set an upper bound to how much we can invest once. To prevent a snowball effect.



#### Regression Part (Machine Learning Part):

##### Bagging & AdaBoostRegression framework(Main part):

- Use B Bootstrap resampling
- AdaBoost with Regreesion Tree as the fundamental model
- Forward Stagewise Model

##### Tried and waived out Regressor: 

- Weighted least square: polynomial with each data assign a count down weight $\gamma^{l}$ where $l$ is the distance from the current data point, means a diminishing weight of the data point, intruduce power p to cross-validation, not good in prectice. 
- Gaussian Process(kernel selection): was waived out due to comlexity of the kernel selection and sophisticated package dependency.



#### Performance:

  #### In the End:

  This project somehow put a difficulty in the Regression part. 

  The result may needs some sort of tuning the hyper-parameters I introduced in the model.
